# cardobject
This project has 4 releases including "vorl√§ufige geilheit"

Use this package to check if crowd-control-card-jsons are valid.

FunctionalCardJson takes a string, validates it by using a schema,
unmarshaling it and marshaling it back.
If the string didn't change it is valid.

ReadableCardJson does the same but comes with a readable effect/ability-text.
